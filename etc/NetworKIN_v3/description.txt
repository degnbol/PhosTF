I added the NetworKIN bash script to be used for running.
It simply sets some of the parameters that are not supposed to be changed in the project, which is location of other code we need and that we use yeast.
Run as: NetworKIN proteins.fasta > networKIN_result.txt
A symlink has been added in datafile so data/4932.protein.sequences.fa refers to a file.
Everything in this project is outdated so I ran blastp manually with settings copied from their internal blastall command and commented out some of their python code.
