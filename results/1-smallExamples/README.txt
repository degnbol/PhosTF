Code to simulate, infer and visualize small toy examples.

- 1-easy: simple example that can easily be inferred with the method.
- 2-ambiguity: regulation that cannot be inferred merely from perturbation data
- 3-noAmbiguity: same network as 2-ambiguity but a few more edges are added so the perturbation data will give enough information for inference.
