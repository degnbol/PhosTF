Collected from supplementary table from "Kinome-wide identification of phosphorylation networks in eukaryotic proteomes" by Luca Parca et al. 2019.
They however simply collected the data from phosgrid (now under biogrid), which we also have access to, in the Post Translational Modification files they provide.
Use this to check that you did not make mistakes when you process the biogrid data.
