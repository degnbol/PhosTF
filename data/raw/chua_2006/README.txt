From publication "Identifying transcription factor functions and targets by phenotypic activation" by Chua et al. 2006.
Send by Chris over email, who had requested the data from the authors.
file "OE_NormalizedRatios.phenoData" contains overview of what each experiment identifer means, "OE_NormalizedRatios.txt" contains log2FC for 2 over expression replicates, one with reversed fluorescence measuring. The sign can be reversed for that one to get log2(OE/WT) instead of log2(WT/OE)
Files with "Del_"... are knockout equivalents.
