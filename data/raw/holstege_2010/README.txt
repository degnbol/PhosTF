Supplementary table S1 downloaded from "http://www.holstegelab.nl/publications/sv/signaling_redundancy/" which was mentioned in the publication "Functional Overlap and Regulatory Links Shape Genetic Interactions between Signaling Pathways" by Holstege et al. 2010.
It is gene measurements as a result from different gene deletions compared to wildtype.

Description on website:
Data S1: Gene Expression Matrix of all kinase/phosphatase mutants
Tab-delimited file that contains both the M ratios (mutant/wildtype) and P-values for all kinase/phosphatase mutants obtained through the limma statistical modeling approach. The first two rows contain the name of the mutant and the data type (M or p_value) for each deletion mutant. The first two columns contain the systematic name (ORF name) and standard gene symbol for every gene present on the microarray. Wildtype variable genes have been excluded.

The publication says:
M is the log2 ratio of normalized fluorescent mRNA expression in the mutant divided by WT.
