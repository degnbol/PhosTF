Great data from 97 PK KOs.
6 replicates, both WT and KO measurements.
From "Machine Learning Predicts the Yeast Metabolome from the Quantitative Proteome of Kinase Knockouts" by Zelezniak et al. 2018.
Collected proteome data from Star Methods -> Key Resources Table -> Deposited Data -> Processed proteome and metabolome data -> https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1320288 -> https://zenodo.org/record/1320289
The proteome data is the important part, since we can more readily apply it.
