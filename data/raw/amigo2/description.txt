Downloaded protein annotations from AmiGO 2 at http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/search/annotation
Filtered by organism: Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C
Filtered by GO class (direct): DNA-binding transcription activator activity, RNA polymerase II-specific
and the equivalent DNA-binding transcription repressor activity, RNA polymerase II-specific
The positive regulators were from the GO class (direct): positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II
and equivalently negative regulators from negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II
positive_elongation.tsv: GO class (direct) = positive regulation of transcription elongation from RNA polymerase II promoter
protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation searched are also GO class (direct)
protein_kinase.tsv and protein_phosphatase.tsv are from GO class (direct) protein kinase activity and similar for phosphatase.
