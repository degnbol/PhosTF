Downloaded from the deletome collection. publication "Large-scale genetic perturbations reveal regulatory networks and an abundance of gene-specific repressors" by Holstege et al. 2014.

The responsive data sets are 700 KOs instead of ~1400 that were "robustly different from wild-type".
The ex wt var refers to removal of measurements of 58 genes that had high variation under wild-type conditions, which means the effect from a KO on them might be unreliable.
I suggest we keep them. Maybe not expand the current list of measured genes if they are not already in it.
svd transformation is from another publication where its purpose is explained: "Cell cycle population effects in perturbation studies" by Holstege 2014
https://www.embopress.org/doi/pdf/10.15252/msb.20145172
Let's start with untransformed data, then we can talk about transformation later if there's time.
A values are absolute measurements of the experiments, M values are relative to wildtype, p-value is statistical significance in difference from wildtype.
