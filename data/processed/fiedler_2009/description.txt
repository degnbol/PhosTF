There are a set of PK edges to be found and a smaller subset restricted by some EMAP test.
EMAP scores are genetic interaction, when two regulators have shared substrate and a EMAP score it doesn't mean there's a physical interaction between the two, only that they both seem to regulate the same target, and from size and sign of EMAP you can tell if they are kinases, phosphatase, one of each, etc.
So, we don't use entries about shared regulation, and we don't limit ourselves to edges with EMAP since not all edges were tested for genetic interaction.
