Kinase substrate interactions with scores.

The help bubble next to selecting score says:
Returns interactions above a score threshold, based on a score given by a comparison to a chosen gold-standard gene-kinase interactions.
The higher the score, the closer it is to that set.
-5 is the minimal value within the whole dataset.
A score of 4.52 corresponds to a P-value of 0.05.
We recommend using 6.4 for high-quality interactions (p-value < 0.01)
