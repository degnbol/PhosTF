Downloaded from STRING database string-db.org under download, only downloading for yeast.
The files contain scored protein interactions. The score is a combined score, based on many parameters, e.g. experimental, text-mining, how often the two proteins are in the same strain etc.
The version downloaded only contains the overall score.
The other file shows some information about the type of interaction for different proteins.
