Interactions are directed since it is data about specific proteins performing specific protein modification at specific targets at specific positions.
Other datatypes from biogrid are undirected and referred to as interactions.
The file containing "PTM" and "RELATIONSHIPS" has data showing which proteins are performing modifications at sites indicated with a #PTM index.
In the file only containing "PTM" in the filename, the $PTM indexes are shown with information about where that site is located and in which protein.
