This file contains Supplementary Methods as well as Supplementary Figures 1 and 2.

Supplementary Table S1A 
[SuppTableS1A_KOTargetGenes_Matrix_DixExp_p0.05.dat]
Matrix with discrete values for all genes across all knockout experiments (p-value < 0.05): significantly up-regulated (1), significantly down-regulated (-1), and no significant change in expression (0).

Supplementary Table S1B 
[SuppTableS1B_KOTargetGenes_Matrix_PValue.dat]
Matrix with p-values for differential expression of all genes across all knockout experiments.

Supplementary Table S1C 
[SuppTableS1C_KOTargetGenes_Matrix_LogFoldChange.dat]
Matrix with log fold-change values for all genes across all knockout experiments.

Supplementary Table S1D 
[SuppTableS1D_KOTargetGenes_Lists_DixExp_p0.05.dat]
List of up-regulated and down-regulated genes for all knockout experiments (p-value < 0.05).

Supplementary Table S2 
[SuppTableS2_KOTargetGenes_FunctionalEnrichments.dat]
List of Gene Ontology, KEGG and Reactome annotations that are enriched among differentially expressed genes for each knockout experiment.

Supplementary Table S3
[SuppTableS3_KOTargetGenes_BindingSiteEnrichments.dat]
List of primary and secondary upstream TF-binding site predictions that are enriched for each knockout experiment.

Supplementary Table S4
[SuppTableS4_InteractingTFs_significant_shared_targets.dat]
List of physically interacting TF pairs that share a significant overlap in target genes.

Supplementary Table S5
[SuppTableS5_Interacting_modules_in_targets.dat]
Modules of physically interacting targets for each knockout experiment. Targets are divided into core protein-protein interactions (differentially expressed in knockout) and neighbourhood categories (core targets and their interactions).
